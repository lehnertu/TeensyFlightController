    To-Do list : TAROS
===========================


system cleanup for monolithic build
-----------------------------------

- base.h includes:
	- message.h
	- module.h
	- port.h
- global.h
	- all global variabes defined in main.cpp
	- logger.h
	- file_writer.h
- system.h includes:
	- all modules
	- all setup (link building)

- system.h should include all module headers
	- all modules should have permanent public pointers (not encapsulated to the setup)
	- every module that include system.h should have full call capability of the other modules
- messages should be more limited (tamplate based typing)
- define a port(queue) input for streaming data between modules (source driven, receiver stored)
	(these are messages now, but use headerless binary data instead, data types defined in receiver module)

	
possibly use LITTLEFS insted of FAT on the SD card
--------------------------------------------------
- small (and fast?)
- resilient to power failures
