To compile a simple test (all servos running periodically)
all files have to be copied into the src/ folder

servo_tester.h
servo_tester.cpp
system.h
system.cpp

mv *.h ../../src/
cp *.cpp ../../src/
cd ../..
make

The last of these files overwrites the present system description of the TAROS system
which must be restored when returning to the full system.
