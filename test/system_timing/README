This is a test case for the communication and the modeule interrupt timing.

To compile the test all files have to be copied into the src/ folder

system.h
system.cpp

cp *.h ../../src/
cp *.cpp ../../src/
cd ../..
make

Some of these files overwrites the present system description of the TAROS system
which must be restored when returning to the full system.
